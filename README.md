# Advent of Code 2025

My attempt at AoC 2025 using PHP 8.4.

If you're using Docker you can run the solutions using the Taskfile commands or copy the Docker commands from the file.

Otherwise, if you have PHP-CLI 8.4 installed you can run the usual `composer install` to setup and run the solutions using `aoc <puzzle_num> <part_num>`.

You'll need to add your `input.txt` and `test-input.txt` files to each solution as I won't be pushing my inputs to the repo.
